    \Large\LaTeX\ is a  free, high-quality system designed for technical and scientific documentation. It is the standard for the publication of scientific documents, but it is quite different from Microsoft Word.\vspace{.2in}

    In this free seminar, all basic concepts and commands required to create a fully-cited technical report will be covered including installation and compilation, inclusion of equations, tables, and source code, automatic bibliography generation, and more.\vspace{.2in}

    Many fully-working examples will be provided and will remain available for download afterward the presentation.
