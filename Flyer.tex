    \Large\LaTeX\ is a  free, high-quality system designed for technical and scientific documentation. It is the \emph{standard} for the publication of scientific documents, but it is quite different from Microsoft Word.\vspace{.2in}

    In this free seminar, all the basic concepts and commands required to create a fully-cited technical report will be covered, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item installation and compilation
        \item math/equations, tables, and graphics
        \item listing of source code (with syntax highlighting)
        \item automatic bibliography generation
        \item \emph{and more!}
    \end{itemize}\vspace{.2in}

    Fully-working examples will be provided and used during this presentation, and will remain available for download afterwards.
