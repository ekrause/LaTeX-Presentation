Appendix
=======

### What is this?
This appendix is included to give working examples for a variety of topics that didn't make the cut to be included in the presentation.  The topics here are not necesarrily more advanced than anything in **[/Examples]**. 

### What's included here?
- Makefile:  A very basic LaTeX makefile, with no magic whatsoever. 
- A-algorithm.tex:  Some examples of algorithms using LaTeX.
- Krause.sty:  A custom "header" file.  The use of such files is reccomended to reduce the size of the document preamble, and this header file includes several useful packages and commands. 
- A-customheader.tex:  A file that demonstrates how to use a custom header file.
- A-size.tex:  Illustrates how to manually change font size in LaTeX (and lists all available sizes)
